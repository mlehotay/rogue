<h2>NAME</h2>

<blockquote>
 rogue - Exploring The Dungeons of Doom
</blockquote>


<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<blockquote>
 <kbd>rogue</kbd> <!-- [ <kbd>-r</kbd> ] --> [ <kbd><i>save_file</i></kbd> ]
 [<kbd>-s</kbd> ] <!-- [ <kbd>-d</kbd> ] -->
</blockquote>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>
 <p><i>Rogue</i> is a computer fantasy game with a new twist. It is CRT
 oriented and the object of the game is to survive the attacks of various
 monsters and get a lot of gold, rather than the puzzle solving orientation of
 most computer fantasy games.

 <p>To get started you really only need to know two commands. The command
 '<kbd>?</kbd>' will give you a list of the available commands and the command
 '<kbd>/</kbd>' will identify the things you see on the screen.

 <p>To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high
 scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere below the 20th
 level of the dungeon and get it out. Nobody has achieved this yet and if
 somebody does, they will probably go down in history as a hero among heroes.

 <p>When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you (by some
 miracle) manage to win, <i>rogue</i> will give you a list of the top-ten
 scorers. The scoring is based entirely upon how much gold you get. There is a
 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.

 <p>If <kbd><i>save_file</i></kbd> is specified, <i>rogue</i> will be restored
 from the specified saved game file. <!-- If the <kbd>-r</kbd> option is used, the
 saved game file is presumed to be the default. -->

 <p>The <kbd>-s</kbd> option will print out the list of scores.

 <!-- <p>The <kbd>-d</kbd> option will kill you and try to add you to the score
 file. -->

 <p>For more detailed directions, read the document <i>A Guide to the Dungeons
 of Doom.</i>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<blockquote>
 <p>Probably infinite, although none are known. However, that Ice Monsters
 sometimes transfix you permanently is <i>not</i> a bug. It's a feature.
