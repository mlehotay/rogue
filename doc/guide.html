</center>

<blockquote>
 <i>Rogue</i> is a visual CRT based fantasy game which runs under the
 UNIX<a href="#endnote1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> timesharing system.
 This paper describes how to play rogue, and gives a few hints for those who
 might otherwise get lost in the Dungeons of Doom.
</blockquote>


<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>You have just finished your years as a student at the local fighter's guild.
After much practice and sweat you have finally completed your training and are
ready to embark upon a perilous adventure. As a test of your skills, the local
guildmasters have sent you into the Dungeons of Doom. Your task is to return
with the Amulet of Yendor. Your reward for the completion of this task will be
a full membership in the local guild. In addition, you are allowed to keep all
the loot you bring back from the dungeons.

<p>In preparation for your journey, you are given an enchanted mace, a bow, and
a quiver of arrows taken from a dragon's hoard in the far off Dark Mountains.
You are also outfitted with elf-crafted armor and given enough food to reach
the dungeons. You say goodbye to family and friends for what may be the last
time and head up the road.

<p>You set out on your way to the dungeons and after several days of uneventful
travel, you see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Dungeons of
Doom. It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance and spend the night
sleeping under the open skies. In the morning you gather your weapons, put on
your armor, eat what is almost your last food, and enter the dungeons.


<h2>2. What is going on here?</h2>

<p>You have just begun a game of rogue. Your goal is to grab as much treasure
as you can, find the Amulet of Yendor, and get out of the Dungeons of Doom
alive. On the screen, a map of where you have been and what you have seen on
the current dungeon level is kept. As you explore more of the level, it appears
on the screen in front of you.

<p>Rogue differs from most computer fantasy games in that it is screen
oriented. Commands are all one or two
keystrokes<a href="#endnote2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and the results
of your commands are displayed graphically on the screen rather than being
explained in words.<a href="#endnote3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a>

<p>Another major difference between rogue and other computer fantasy games is
that once you have solved all the puzzles in a standard fantasy game, it has
lost most of its excitement and it ceases to be fun. Rogue, on the other hand,
generates a new dungeon every time you play it and even the author finds it an
entertaining and exciting game.


<h2>3. What do all those things on the screen mean?</h2>

<p>In order to understand what is going on in rogue you have to first get some
grasp of what rogue is doing with the screen. The rogue screen is intended to
replace the "You can see ..." descriptions of standard fantasy games. Figure 1
is a sample of what a rogue screen might look like.

<center>
<pre><samp>

 Figure 1
</samp></pre>
</center>


<h3>3.1 The bottom line</h3>

<p>At the bottom line of the screen are a few pieces of cryptic information
describing your current status. Here is an explanation of what these things
mean:

<p>
<table>

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>Level&nbsp;</samp>
 <td>This number indicates how deep you have gone in the dungeon. It starts at
 one and goes up as you go deeper into the dungeon.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>Gold</samp>
 <td>The number of gold pieces you have managed to find and keep with you so
 far.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>Hp</samp>
 <td>Your current and maximum health points. Health points indicate how much
 damage you can take before you die. The more you get hit in a fight, the lower
 they get. You can regain health points by resting. The number in parentheses
 is the maximum number your health points can reach.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>Str</samp>
 <td>Your current strength and maximum ever strength. This can be any integer
 less than or equal to 99, or greater than or equal to 1. The higher the
 number, the stronger you are. The number in the parentheses is the maximum
 strength you have attained so far this game.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>Arm</samp>
 <td>Your current armor protection. This number indicates how effective your
 armor is in stopping blows from unfriendly creatures. The higher this number
 is, the more effective the armor.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>Exp</samp>
 <td>These two numbers give your current experience level and experience
 points. As you do things, you gain experience points. At certain experience
 point totals, you gain an experience level. The more experienced you are, the
 better you are able to fight and to withstand magical attacks.

</table>


<h3>3.2 The top line</h3>

<p>The top line of the screen is reserved for printing messages that describe
things that are impossible to represent visually. If you see a
"<samp>--More--</samp>" on the top line, this means that rogue wants to print
another message on the screen, but it wants to make certain that you have read
the one that is there first. To read the next message, just type a space.


<h3>3.3 The rest of the screen</h3>

<p>The rest of the screen is the map of the level as you have explored it so
far. Each symbol on the screen represents something. Here is a list of what the
various symbols mean:

<p>
<table>

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>@</samp>
 <td>This symbol represents you, the adventurer.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>-|</samp>
 <td>These symbols represent the walls of rooms.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>+</samp>
 <td>A door to/from a room.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>.</samp>
 <td>The floor of a room.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>#</samp>
 <td>The floor of a passage between rooms.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>*</samp>
 <td>A pile or pot of gold.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>)</samp>
 <td>A weapon of some sort.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>]</samp>
 <td>A piece of armor.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>!</samp>
 <td>A flask containing a magic potion.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>?</samp>
 <td>A piece of paper, usually a magic scroll.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>=</samp>
 <td>A ring with magic properties

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>/</samp>
 <td>A magical staff or wand

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>^</samp>
 <td>A trap, watch out for these.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>%</samp>
 <td>A staircase to other levels

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><samp>:</samp>
 <td>A piece of food.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td nowrap><samp>A-Z&nbsp;</samp>
 <td>The uppercase letters represent the various inhabitants of the Dungeons of
 Doom. Watch out, they can be nasty and vicious.

</table>


<h2>4. Commands</h2>

<p>Commands are given to rogue by typing one or two characters. Most commands
can be preceded by a count to repeat them (e.g. typing '<kbd>10s</kbd>' will do
ten searches). Commands for which counts make no sense have the count ignored.
To cancel a count or a prefix, type <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>. The list of
commands is rather long, but it can be read at any time during the game with
the '<kbd>?</kbd>' command. Here it is for reference, with a short explanation
of each command.

<p>
<table>

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>?</kbd>
 <td>The help command. Asks for a character to give help on. If you type a
 '<kbd>*</kbd>', it will list all the commands, otherwise it will explain what
 the character you typed does.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>/</kbd>
 <td>This is the "What is that on the screen?" command. A '<kbd>/</kbd>'
 followed by any character that you see on the level, will tell you what that
 character is. For instance, typing '<kbd>/@</kbd>' will tell you that the
 '<samp>@</samp>' symbol represents you, the player.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>h<br>H<br>^H</kbd>
 <td>Move left. You move one space to the left. If you use upper case
 '<kbd>H</kbd>', you will continue to move left until you run into something.
 This works for all movement commands (e.g. '<kbd>L</kbd>' means run in
 direction '<kbd>l</kbd>'). If you use the '<kbd>&lt;CTRL&gt;-h</kbd>', you
 will continue moving in the specified direction until you pass something
 interesting or run into a wall. You should experiment with this, since it is a
 very useful command, but very difficult to describe. This also works for all
 movement commands.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>j</kbd>
 <td>Move down.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>k</kbd>
 <td>Move up.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>l</kbd>
 <td>Move right.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>y</kbd>
 <td>Move diagonally up and left.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>u</kbd>
 <td>Move diagonally up and right.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>b</kbd>
 <td>Move diagonally down and left.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>n</kbd>
 <td>Move diagonally down and right.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>t</kbd>
 <td>Throw an object. This is a prefix command. When followed with a direction
 it throws an object in the specified direction. (e.g. type '<kbd>th</kbd>' to
 throw something to the left.)

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>f</kbd>
 <td>Fight until someone dies. When followed with a direction this will force
 you to fight the creature in that direction until either you or it bites the
 big one.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><a name="move"><kbd>m</kbd></a>
 <td>Move onto something without picking it up. This will move you one space in
 the direction you specify and, if there is an object there you can pick up, it
 won't do it.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>z</kbd>
 <td>Zap prefix. Point a staff or wand in a given direction and fire it. Even
 non-directional staves must be pointed in some direction to be used.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>^</kbd>
 <td>Identify trap command. If a trap is on your map and you can't remember
 what type it is, you can get rogue to remind you by getting next to it and
 typing '<kbd>^</kbd>' followed by the direction that would move you on top of
 it.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>s</kbd>
 <td>Search for traps and secret doors. Examine each space immediately adjacent
 to you for the existence of a trap or secret door. There is a large chance
 that even if there is something there, you won't find it, so you might have to
 search a while before you find something.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>&gt;</kbd>
 <td>Climb down a staircase to the next level. Not surprisingly, this can only
 be done if you are standing on staircase.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>&lt;</kbd>
 <td>Climb up a staircase to the level above. This can't be done without the
 Amulet of Yendor in your possession.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>.</kbd>
 <td>Rest. This is the "do nothing" command. This is good for waiting and
 healing.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>,</kbd>
 <td>Pick up something. This picks up whatever you are currently standing on,
 if you are standing on anything at all.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>i</kbd>
 <td>Inventory. List what you are carrying in your pack.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>I</kbd>
 <td>Selective inventory. Tells you what a single item in your pack is.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>q</kbd>
 <td>Quaff one of the potions you are carrying.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>r</kbd>
 <td>Read one of the scrolls in your pack.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>e</kbd>
 <td>Eat food from your pack.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>w</kbd>
 <td>Wield a weapon. Take a weapon out of your pack and carry it for use in
 combat, replacing the one you are currently using (if any).

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>W</kbd>
 <td>Wear armor. You can only wear one suit of armor at a time. This takes
 extra time.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>T</kbd>
 <td>Take armor off. You can't remove armor that is cursed. This takes extra
 time.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>P</kbd>
 <td>Put on a ring. You can wear only two rings at a time (one on each hand).
 If you aren't wearing any rings, this command will ask you which hand you want
 to wear it on, otherwise, it will place it on the unused hand. The program
 assumes that you wield your sword in your right hand.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>R</kbd>
 <td>Remove a ring. If you are only wearing one ring, this command takes it
 off. If you are wearing two, it will ask you which one you wish to remove.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>d</kbd>
 <td>Drop an object. Take something out of your pack and leave it lying on the
 floor. Only one object can occupy each space. You cannot drop a cursed object
 at all if you are wielding or wearing it.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><a name="call"><kbd>c</kbd></a>
 <td>Call an object something. If you have a type of object in your pack which
 you wish to remember something about, you can use the call command to give a
 name to that type of object. This is usually used when you figure out what a
 potion, scroll, ring, or staff is after you pick it up but before it is truly
 identified. Each type of scroll and potion will become identified after its
 first use. <!-- after you pick it up, or when you want to remember which of
 those swords in your pack you were wielding. -->

 <!-- D
 Print out which things you've discovered something about. This command will
 ask you what type of thing you are interested in. If you type the character
 for a given type of object (e.g. '<kbd>!</kbd>' for potion) it will tell you
 which kinds of that type of object you've discovered (i.e., figured out what
 they are). This command works for potions, scrolls, rings, and staves and
 wands. -->

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>o</kbd>
 <td>Examine and set options. This command is further explained in the
 <a href="#options">section on options</a>.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>^R</kbd>
 <td>Redraws the screen. Useful if spurious messages or transmission errors
 have messed up the display.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>^P</kbd>
 <td>Print last message. Useful when a message disappears before you can read
 it. Consecutive repetitions of this command will reveal the last five messages.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;&nbsp;</kbd>
 <td>Cancel a command, prefix, or count.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>!</kbd>
 <td>Escape to a shell for some commands.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>Q</kbd>
 <td>Quit. Leave the game.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>S</kbd>
 <td>Save the current game in a file. It will ask you whether you wish to use
 the default save file. <i>Caveat</i>: Rogue won't let you start up a copy of a
 saved game, and it removes the save file as soon as you start up a restored
 game. This is to prevent people from saving a game just before a dangerous
 position and then restarting it if they die. To restore a saved game, give the
 file name as an argument to rogue. As in

 <blockquote>
  <samp>%</samp> <kbd>rogue <i>save_file</i></kbd>
 </blockquote>

 <!-- <p>To restart from the default save file (see below), run % rogue -r -->

 <p><tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>v</kbd>
 <td>Prints the program version number.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>)</kbd>
 <td>Print the weapon you are currently wielding

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>]</kbd>
 <td>Print the armor you are currently wearing

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><kbd>=</kbd>
 <td>Print the rings you are currently wearing

 <!-- @ Reprint the status line on the message line -->

</table>


<h2>5. Rooms</h2>

<p>Rooms in the dungeons are lit as you enter them. Upon leaving a room, all
monsters inside the room are erased from the screen. In the darkness of a
corridor, you can only see one space in all directions around you.

<!-- Rooms in the dungeons are either lit or dark. If you walk into a lit room,
the entire room will be drawn on the screen as soon as you enter. If you walk
into a dark room, it will only be displayed as you explore it. Upon leaving a
room, all monsters inside the room are erased from the screen. In the darkness
you can only see one space in all directions around you. A corridor is always
dark. -->


<h2>6. Fighting</h2>

<p>If you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to run into it.
Many times a monster you find will mind its own business unless you attack it.
It is often the case that discretion is the better part of valor.


<h2>7. Objects you can find</h2>

<p>When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to pick the
object up. This is accomplished in rogue by walking over the object (unless you
use the '<kbd>m</kbd>' prefix, <a href="#move">see above</a>). If you are
carrying too many things, the program will tell you and it won't pick up the
object, otherwise it will add it to your pack and tell you what you just picked
up.

<p>Many of the commands that operate on objects must prompt you to find out
which object you want to use. If you change your mind and don't want to do that
command after all, just type an <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> and the command will be
aborted.

<p>Some objects, like armor and weapons, are easily differentiated. Others,
like scrolls and potions, are given labels which vary according to type. During
a game, any two of the same kind of object with the same label are the same
type. However, the labels will vary from game to game.

<p>When you use one of these labeled objects, its effect may be obvious.
Potions or scrolls will become identified at this point, but not other items.
If you want to call these other items something so you will recognize it later,
you can use the "call" command (<a href="#call">see above</a>). 

<!-- When you use one of these labeled objects, if its effect is obvious, rogue
will remember what it is for you. If it's effect isn't extremely obvious you
will be asked what you want to scribble on it so you will recognize it later,
or you can use the "call" command (see above). -->


<h3>7.1 Weapons</h3>

<p>Some weapons, like arrows, come in bunches, but most come one at a time. In
order to use a weapon, you must wield it. To fire an arrow out of a bow, you
must first wield the bow, then throw the arrow. You can only wield one weapon
at a time, but you can't change weapons if the one you are currently wielding
is cursed. The commands to use weapons are '<kbd>w</kbd>' (wield) and
'<kbd>t</kbd>' (throw).


<h3>7.2 Armor</h3>

<p>There are various sorts of armor lying around in the dungeon. Some of it is
enchanted, some is cursed, and some is just normal. Different armor types have
different armor protection. The higher the armor protection, the more
protection the armor affords against the blows of monsters. Here is a list of
the various armor types and their normal armor protection:

<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
 <tr>
  <th>Type
  <th>Protection
 <tr>
  <td>None
  <td align=center>0
 <tr>
  <td>Leather armor
  <td align=center>2
 <tr>
  <td>Studded leather / Ring mail
  <td align=center>3
 <tr>
  <td>Scale mail
  <td align=center>4
 <tr>
  <td>Chain mail
  <td align=center>5
 <tr>
  <td>Banded mail / Splint mail
  <td align=center>6
 <tr>
  <td>Plate mail
  <td align=center>7
</table>
</center>

<p>If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will be higher than
normal. If a suit of armor is cursed, its armor protection will be lower, and
you will not be able to remove it. However, not all armor with a protection
that is lower than normal is cursed.

<p>The commands to use weapons are '<kbd>W</kbd>' (wear) and '<kbd>T</kbd>'
(take off).


<h3>7.3 Scrolls</h3>

<p>Scrolls come with titles in an unknown
tongue.<a href="#endnote4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> After you read a
scroll, it disappears from your pack. The command to use a scroll is
'<kbd>r</kbd>' (read).


<h3>7.4 Potions</h3>

<p>Potions are labeled by the color of the liquid inside the flask. They
disappear after being quaffed. The command to use a potion is '<kbd>q</kbd>'
(quaff).


<h3>7.5 Staves and Wands</h3>

<p>Staves and wands do the same kinds of things. Staves are identified by a
type of wood; wands by a type of metal or bone. They are generally things you
want to do to something over a long distance, so you must point them at what
you wish to affect to use them. Some staves are not affected by the direction
they are pointed, though. Staves come with multiple magic charges, the number
being random, and when they are used up, the staff is just a piece of wood or
metal.

<p>The command to use a wand or staff is '<kbd>z</kbd>' (zap)


<h3>7.6 Rings</h3>

<p>Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively permanent magic,
unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and staves. Of course,
the bad rings are also more powerful. Most rings also cause you to use up food
more rapidly, the rate varying with the type of ring. Rings are differentiated
by their stone settings. The commands to use rings are '<kbd>P</kbd>' (put on)
and '<kbd>R</kbd>' (remove).


<h3>7.7 Food</h3>

<p>Food is necessary to keep you going. If you go too long without eating you
will faint, and eventually die of starvation. The command to use food is
'<kbd>e</kbd>' (eat).


<h2><a name="options">8. Options</a></h2>

<p>Due to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of the way rogue should
do things, there are a set of options you can set that cause rogue to behave in
various different ways.


<h3>8.1 Setting the options</h3>

<p>There are two ways to set the options. The first is with the '<kbd>o</kbd>'
command of rogue; the second is with the ROGUEOPTS environment
variable.<a href="#endnote5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a>


<h4>8.1.1 Using the '<kbd>o</kbd>' command</h4>

<p>When you type '<kbd>o</kbd>' in rogue, it clears the screen and displays the
current settings for all the options. It then places the cursor by the value of
the first option and waits for you to type. You can type an
<kbd>&lt;ENTER&gt;</kbd> which means to go to the next option, a '<kbd>-</kbd>'
which means to go to the previous option, an <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> which means
to return to the game, or you can give the option a value. For boolean options
this merely involves typing '<kbd>t</kbd>' for true or '<kbd>f</kbd>' for
false. For string options, type the new value followed by an
<kbd>&lt;ENTER&gt;</kbd>.


<h4>8.1.2 Using the ROGUEOPTS variable</h4>

<p>The ROGUEOPTS variable is a string containing a comma separated list of
initial values for the various options. Boolean variables can be turned on by
listing their name or turned off by putting a "no" in front of the name. Thus
to set up an environment variable so that <i>jump</i> is on, <i>passgo</i>
<!-- terse --> is off, and the <i>name</i> is set to "Blue Meanie", use the
command

<blockquote>
 <samp>%</samp> <kbd>setenv ROGUEOPTS "jump,nopassgo,name=Blue
 Meanie"</kbd><a href="#endnote6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></a>
 <!-- % setenv ROGUEOPTS "jump,noterse,name=Blue Meanie" -->
</blockquote>


<h3>8.2 Option list</h3>

<p>Here is a list of the options and an explanation of what each one is for.
The default value for each is enclosed in square brackets. For character string
options, input over forty characters will be ignored.

<p>
<table>

 <!-- <i>terse</i> [ <i>noterse</i> ]
 Useful for those who are tired of the sometimes lengthy messages of rogue.
 This is a useful option for playing on slow terminals, so this option defaults
 to <i>terse</i> if you are on a slow (1200 baud or under) terminal. -->

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><i>jump</i><td>[ <i>nojump</i> ]<br>
 If this option is set, running moves will not be displayed until you reach the
 end of the move. This saves considerable cpu and display time. This option
 defaults to <i>jump</i> if you are using a slow terminal.

 <!-- <i>flush</i> [ <i>noflush</i> ]
 All typeahead is thrown away after each round of battle. This is useful for
 those who type far ahead and then watch in dismay as a Bat kills them. -->

 <!-- <i>seefloor</i> [ <i>seefloor</i> ]
 Display the floor around you on the screen as you move through dark rooms. Due
 to the amount of characters generated, this option defaults to
 <i>noseefloor</i> if you are using a slow terminal. -->
                 
 <tr valign=top>
 <td><i>passgo</i>&nbsp;<td>[ <i>nopassgo</i> ]<br>
 Follow turnings in passageways. If you run in a passage and you run into stone
 or a wall, rogue will see if it can turn to the right or left. If it can only
 turn one way, it will turn that way. If it can turn either or neither, it will
 stop. This algorithm can sometimes lead to slightly confusing occurrences
 which is why it defaults to <i>nopassgo</i>.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><i>skull</i><td>[ <i>skull</i> ]<br>
 Print out the skull at the end if you get killed. This is nice but slow, so
 you can turn it off if you like.

 <!-- <i>tombstone</i> [ <i>tombstone</i> ]
 Print out the tombstone at the end if you get killed. This is nice but slow,
 so you can turn it off if you like. -->

 <!-- <i>inven</i> [ <i>overwrite</i> ]
 Inventory type. This can have one of three values: <i>overwrite</i>,
 <i>slow</i>, or <i>clear</i>. With <i>overwrite</i> the top lines of the map
 are overwritten with the list when inventory is requested or when "Which item
 do you wish to ...?" questions are answered with a '<kbd>*</kbd>'. However, if
 the list is longer than a screenful, the screen is cleared. With <i>slow</i>,
 lists are displayed one item at a time on the top of the screen, and with
 <i>clear</i>, the screen is cleared, the list is displayed, and then the
 dungeon level is re-displayed. Due to speed considerations, <i>clear</i> is
 the default for terminals without clear-to-end-of-line capabilities. -->

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><i>name</i><td>[ account name ]<br>
 This is the name of your character. It is used if you get on the top ten
 scorer's list.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><i>fruit</i><td>[ slime-mold ]<br>
 This should hold the name of a fruit that you enjoy eating. It is basically a
 whimsey that rogue uses in a couple of places.

 <tr valign=top>
 <td><i>file</i><td>[~/rogue.save ]<br>
 The default file name for saving the game. If your phone is hung up by
 accident, rogue will automatically save the game in this file. The file name
 may start with the special character '~' which expands to be your home
 directory.

<h2>9. Scoring</h2>

<p>Rogue maintains a list of the top scoring people or scores on your machine.

<!-- Rogue usually maintains a list of the top scoring people or scores on your
machine. Depending on how it is set up, it can post either the top scores or
the top players. In the latter case, each account on the machine can post only
one non-winning score on this list. -->

If you score higher than someone else on this list, or better your previous
score on the list, you will be inserted in the proper place under your current
name. <!-- How many scores are kept can also be set up by whoever installs it
on your machine. -->

<p>If you quit the game, you get out with all of your gold intact. If, however,
you get killed in the Dungeons of Doom, your body is forwarded to your
next-of-kin, along with 90% of your gold; ten percent of your gold is kept by
the Dungeons' wizard as a
fee.<a href="#endnote7"><sup><small>7</small></sup></a> This should make you
consider whether you want to take one last hit at that monster and possibly
live, or quit and thus stop with whatever you have. If you quit, you do get all
your gold, but if you swing and live, you might find more.

<p>If you just want to see what the current top players/games list is, you can
type

<blockquote>
 <samp>%</samp> <kbd>rogue -s</kbd>

<h2>10. Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Rogue was originally conceived of by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy. Ken
Arnold and Michael Toy then smoothed out the user interface, and added jillions
of new features. We would like to thank Bob Arnold, Michelle Busch, Andy
Hatcher, Kipp Hickman, Mark Horton, Daniel Jensen, Bill Joy, Joe Kalash, Steve
Maurer, Marty McNary, Jan Miller, and Scott Nelson for their ideas and
assistance; and also the teeming multitudes who graciously ignored work,
school, and social life to play rogue and send us bugs, complaints,
suggestions, and just plain flames. And also Mom.

<p>The public domain version of rogue now distributed with Berkeley UNIX was
written by Timothy Stoehr.
