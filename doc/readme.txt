Rogue Clone IV version 2.1
==========================

Welcome to Rogue Clone IV!

In previous versions this program was called DOS Rogue Clone. The name was
changed when we adapted the game to run as a Windows console application. Expect
ports to other systems in the future.

The files rogue.html and guide.html contain all the information you need to
play. Help is also available within the game by using the '?' and '/' commands.
