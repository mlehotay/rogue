<h2>NAME</h2>

<blockquote>
 rogue - Exploring The Dungeons of Doom With a Rogue Clone
</blockquote>


<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<blockquote>
 <kbd>rogue</kbd> [ <kbd><i>save_file</i></kbd> ] [ <kbd>-s</kbd>]
</blockquote>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>
 <p>This game is a clone of the rogue 5.3 game that is part of the Berkeley
 Software Distribution (BSD) Tape.

 <p>The command characters are precisely the same as in standard rogue 5.3.
 <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd>,
 <kbd>u</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>, and <kbd>n</kbd> move you one step. Capitalize it,
 and you move until you run into something. Use the control key instead, and
 you move until you are next to something.

 <p>Whenever the program asks you for an inventory letter, you can type
 '<kbd>*</kbd>' to get a list of the logical choices. Sometimes, however, you
 don't want to see that list, but instead you want to see the list of your
 scrolls, potions, weapons, or whatever. In these cases you can type one of
 <kbd>?!=:/)]</kbd> to see a menu of your scrolls, potions, rings, foods,
 wands, weapons or armor respectively. This is especially useful when you know
 you want to drop a particular item, a scroll for example, but you don't want
 to pick it from the entire list, just from your collection of scrolls.

 <p>When you type '<kbd>&lt;CTRL&gt;-a</kbd>', you are shown a line that looks
 like:

 <blockquote>
  <samp>R-Hp: 6.50, E-Hp: 7.00 (!: 2, V: 0)</samp>
 </blockquote>

 <p>This line refers to Hp-raise averages. Each time your experience level goes
 up, your Hp is increased by a random amount not to exceed 10. If you are
 curious about your luck in these raises, you can use the '<kbd>^A</kbd>'
 command. In the example above <samp>R-Hp</samp> stands for "real Hp" which is
 exactly your average Hp raise during the game. <samp>E-Hp</samp> stands for
 effective Hp, and is the same as <samp>R-Hp</samp> except Hp raises from
 potions, and Hp subtractions from vampires are factored in. In the above
 between the parentheses, it shows that 2 Hp points were given as a result of
 quaffing potions of healing, and that vampires have taken way none. All of
 these Hp numbers refer to your max Hp number; the rightmost number in
 <samp>Hp:&nbsp;(15)22</samp> in the status line at the bottom of your rogue
 screen.

 <p>The '<kbd>X</kbd>' command silently creates a file in your current directory called
 rogue.screen. This file contains a copy of your screen at the time you typed
 typed the '<kbd>X</kbd>' This works at absolutely any point in the program. It is useful
 for showing other folks what kind of a mess you got into, or what a great game
 you were having. This functionality means that you cannot use the letter '<kbd>X</kbd>'
 when 'calling' an object something.

 <p>The <kbd>-s</kbd> option prints the score file and exits.

 of Doom.</i>
