Rogue Clone IV compilation instructions
=======================================

Rogue Clone IV can be compiled with a number of different compilers and for a
number of different systems. This file contains instructions for building rogue
and links to places to go for help if need it.

The first thing you should do is visit http://rogueclone.sourceforge.net and
make sure you have the latest version of the source code. Then unpack the code
to a dedicated new directory, which you can call anything you want. In these
instructions it will be referred to as the "top" directory. Below the top
directory there should be three subdirectories:

The doc directory contains documentation and other general information
The src directory contains the source code for Rogue Clone IV
The sys directory contains makefiles and other system dependant things

To compile a 16-bit DOS executable using Open Watcom
  1) cd to the sys subdirectory and run setup wcc
  2) cd to the top directory and run wmake

To compile a 32-bit DOS executable using DJGPP
  1) cd to the sys subdirectory and run setup gcc
  2) cd to the top directory run make

To compile a 32-bit Windows console application with Visual C++
  1) cd to the sys subdirectory and run setup msc
  2) cd to the top directory and run nmake

That's it. If everything went as it should have your executable will be in the
newly created exe directory.

If you experience any problems email the rogueclone-devel mailing list at
rogueclone-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and ask for help. You can view the list
