NAME
     rogue - Exploring The Dungeons of Doom With a Rogue Clone

SYNOPSIS
     rogue [ save_file ] [ -s ]

DESCRIPTION
     This game is a clone of the rogue 5.3 game that is  part  of
     the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Tape.

     The command characters are precisely the same as in standard
     rogue  5.3.   h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n move you one step.  Capitalize
     it, and you move until you run into something.  Use the con-
     trol  key  instead, and you move until you are next to some-
     thing.

     Whenever the program asks you for an inventory  letter,  you
     can  type  '*'  to get a list of the logical choices.  Some-
     times, however, you don't want to see that list, but instead
     you  want to see the list of your scrolls, potions, weapons,
     or whatever.  In these cases you can type one of ?!=:/)]  to
     see  a  menu  of your scrolls, potions, rings, foods, wands,
     weapons or armor  respectively.  This is  especially  useful
     when  you  know you want to drop a particular item, a scroll
     for example, but you don't want to pick it from  the  entire
     list, just from your collection of scrolls.

     When you type control-a, you are shown  a  line  that  looks
     like:

               R-Hp: 6.50, E-Hp: 7.00 (!: 2, V: 0)

     This line refers  to  Hp-raise  averages.   Each  time  your
     experience  level  goes up, your Hp is increased by a random
     amount not to exceed 10.  If you are curious about your luck
     in these raises, you can use the ^A command.  In the example
     above R-Hp stands for "real Hp" which is exactly your  aver-
     age Hp raise during the game.  E-Hp stands for effective Hp,
     and is the same as R-Hp except Hp raises from  potions,  and
     Hp-subtractions from vampires are factored in.  In the above
     between the parentheses, it shows  that  2  Hp  points  were
     given  as  a result of quaffing potions of healing, and that
     vampires have taken way none.  All of these Hp numbers refer
     to your max Hp number; the rightmost number in Hp: (15)22 in
     the status line at the bottom of your rogue screen.

     The '&' command silently creates  a  file  in  your  current
     directory  called  SCREEN.TXT.  This file contains a copy of
     your screen at the time you typed typed the '&'.  This works
     at  absolutely  any  point in the program.  It is useful for
     showing other folks what kind of a mess  you  got  into,  or
     what a great game you were having.  This functionality means
     that you cannot use the '&' symbol when 'calling' an  object
     something.

     The -s (Reg.)option prints the score file and exits.

     the Dungeons of Doom.
